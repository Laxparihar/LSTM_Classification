# LSTM_Classification
LSTM_Classification is a script that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text classification tasks. It preprocesses input text, trains an LSTM model, and classifies text into predefined categories. The file segregation involves splitting data into training, validation, and test sets for effective model evaluation.
